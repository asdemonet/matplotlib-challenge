## Three Observations  from Pymaceuticals

### Observation the First:
From the Summary Statistics

### Observation the Second:

### Observation the Third:
From the scatterplot of Average Tumor Volume by Mouse Weight, we can see a strong positive correlation between the volume of a tumor and the weight of the mouse in question. That is to say, mice that weight more are much more likely to have larger tumors than mice that weigh less.

## Three Observations  from Pymaceuticals

### Observation the First:
From the Summary Statistics, Ramicane and Capomulin have the lowest mean tumor sizes, median tumor sizes, and tumor variance. This could suggest that these two treatments are more effective than other medications, though further examination and visualization will be necessary.
From bar and pie charts we can verify that our sample is evenly distributed between medications as well as by gender. That is to say that each medication has a nearly equal number of mice being studied and that these groups are evenly matched male to female. This is good, because it means that the sample is representative of the population.

### Observation the Second:
In Quartile, Outliers and Boxplots, it becomes more clear that Ramicane and Capomulin are the more effective treaments. The boxplots show that these two have much lower values for Final Tumor Volume (mm3) when compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin treatments. In fact, the ranges of tumor sizes for Ramicane and Capomulin are almost entirely below the ranges for Infubinol and Ceftamin, with only a small overlap in values and one noticeable outlier for Infubinol.

### Observation the Third:
From the line graph and scatter plot visualizations, we can begin to draw conclusions on certain correlations. For example, we see a negative relationship between tumor size and timepoint in the Capomulin treatment of Mouse x401, which would seem to indicate that the medication is working as intended to reduce tumor size.
However, we can also see from the scatterplot of Average Tumor Volume by Mouse Weight, that there is a strong positive correlation between the volume of a tumor and the weight of the mouse in question. That is to say, mice that weight more are much more likely to have larger tumors than mice that weigh less. This is certainly something to keep in mind when analyzing the effectivity of any medication based on tumor volume alone.
